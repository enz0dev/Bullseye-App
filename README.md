# Bullseye-App

Welcome to the Bullseye App! This fun and interactive game challenges you to test your accuracy and precision as you try to hit a target value using a slider. The target value is randomly generated between 1 and 100, and your goal is to get as close to it as possible.

## Features
- Simple and Intuitive Interface: Easy-to-use slider to select your guess.
- Random Target Values: Each round presents a new challenge with a randomly generated target value between 1 and 100.
- Score Calculation: Points are awarded based on how close your guess is to the target value.
- Feedback and Scoring: Receive immediate feedback on your guess and see your score for each round.
  
## How to Play:
- Start a New Round: A random target value between 1 and 100 will be displayed.
- Use the Slider: Move the slider to select the value you think is closest to the target.
- Submit Your Guess: Click the "Hit Me" button to submit your guess.
- See Your Score: The app will show how close your guess was to the target value and display your score for that round.
- Play Again: Start a new round and try to beat your previous score!
  
## Scoring
- The closer your guess is to the target value, the higher your score.
- A perfect guess (exact match) earns the highest points.
- Points decrease as your guess deviates from the target value.
- A scoreboard ranks your score against others.
